function getProperties(propsContext)

This simple function sets properties which will be used by the rest of the policies in the MWM.


** clearFlag **

boolean (TRUE or FALSE).

Use clearFlag = TRUE if you want the maintenance flag on events cleared when windows expire

Use clearFlag = FALSE if you want Impact to leave the events tagged as in maintenance after the window expires

Example setting--
clearFlag = TRUE;

Default is TRUE




** flagExistingEvents **

boolean (TRUE or FALSE).

Use flagExistingEvents = TRUE if you want Impact to flag as "in maintenance" events which
last came in (based on LastOccurrence) before the time window started.

UseflagExistingEvents = FALSE if you want Impact to NOT flag events as "in maintenance" unless
they come in during the maintenance window.


Example 1-- an event for Node ADG111 comes in at 5:30pm.  At 6:00pm, a maintenance window for ADG111 starts.
flagExistingEvents = TRUE, so the event that came in at 5:30pm will be tagged as "in maintenance".

Example 2-- an event for Node ADG222 comes in at 10:50pm.  At 11pm, a maintenance window for ADG222 starts.
flagExistingEvents = FALSE, so the event that came in at 10:50pm will NOT be tagged as "in maintenance".

Default is TRUE
