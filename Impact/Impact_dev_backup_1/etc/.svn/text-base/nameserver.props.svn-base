# Netcool Nameserver config file
#
# Point the values below to your Netcool Nameserver.
# By default the nameserver is deployed on the Netcool GUI Server.
# However, if you moved the nameserver.war file to a different
# J2EE server, you'll need to enter the address of that host below.
# The host and port are the ones that the J2EE server is listening on
# for http requests. The location is the nameserver's address
# (/nameserver/services by default). The userid and password fields need
# to match the ones set in the nameserver's web.xml file ("admin" and
# "netcool" by default).
